# FastMST
Project for Advanced Algorithm and Parallel Programming course of Academic Year 2018-2019

The project implements using Nvidia CUDA the parallel algorithm proposed in [Fast minimum spanning tree for large graphs on the GPU](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1572769.1572796) to solve the minimum spanning tree (MST) problem.

The solution was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and was tested both on:
- [NVIDIA GeForce GT 520 with 1 GB DDR3](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-gt-520.c285)
- [NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 with 6 GB DDR5](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-gtx-1060-6-gb.c2862) (a big thank to @EmilioImp for this!) 

using [9th DIMACS Implementation Challenge](http://users.diag.uniroma1.it/challenge9/download.shtml) graphs and [graph randomly generated by BOOST RMAT]
(https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_53_0/libs/graph_parallel/doc/html/scalable_rmat_generator.html).

The results were verified against [Boost implementation of kruskal minimum spanning tree algorithm](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_53_0/libs/graph/doc/kruskal_min_spanning_tree.html) which has been taken as golden model.

The Visual Studio solution consist of 4 projects and is structured as follows:
- [FastMST](./FastMST), implements the algorithm proposed in the paper and the main functionalities of graph object (load from a DIMACS file/add edge/print in graphviz format/ ecc...);   

- [MST](./MST), recalls the algorithm implemented in FastMST to solve the MST problem on a given graph and outputs the MST cost; 

- [repeatMST](./repeatMST), recalls the algorithm implemented in FastMST to solve the MST problem a number of times on a given graph; 

- [verifyMST](./verifyMST), recalls the algorithm implemented in FastMST to solve the MST problem on a given graph and verifies that the final cost of the MST coincides with the one outputted by the golden models and that results from intermediate graphs are correct.

- [generateDimacsGraph](./generateDimacsGraph), generates a [random graph using BOOST library](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_53_0/libs/graph_parallel/doc/html/scalable_rmat_generator.html).

The directory [Results](./Results) contained the outputs of the runs and a the fianl presentation.
